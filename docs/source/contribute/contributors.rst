============

This package was initiated by `Andrey Rybakov <https://adrybakov.com/>`_ as a simple sandbox
for the condense matter. With time and the help of many contributors, it has
evolved into a powerful tool for the analysis of the condensed matter systems.

Here's a list of all the contributors who shape its evolution:

* `Marko Marino <https://github.com/marcomarino123>`_
* You can be the next one!

Thank you to all of our contributors for your hard work and dedication!
