Documentation guide
*******************

The documentation of the RAD-tools is build by Sphinx.

For the docstrings follow the |numpydoc|_ style guide.

The complete documentation guide is not formed yet. But the following rules are already defined:

* For the module guide each function and class has to have "Import" section.
* Each class has to have "Creation" section.
* Each page of the module guide have to have the link to the corresponding page of the API.

More rules will appear soon. The documentation guide will evolve until it will be complete.
If you have any question about the writing of the documentation, please contact the
|Author|_.
