*******************
RAD-tools interface
*******************

Yes, it is interface to itself.

Function :py:func:`load_template` reads spin Hamiltonian template file
and constructs :py:class:`ExchangeTemplate` from it.

Here is full template file specification:


.. _template-draft:

Template specification
======================
Template file helps to choose particular bonds for filtering of spin Hamiltonian
or for extracting model with grouped parameters
(i.e. :math:`J_1`, :math:`J_2`, ...).

Here is the draft of the template file which is provided by the script:

.. literalinclude:: ../../../../examples/rad-make-template/template.txt
    :language: text
    :linenos:

Line 1-14: Logo and stats of RAD-tools.

Line 15: Header of the file (20 or more "=" symbols).

Line 16: Flag of the neighbors section, have to be in the file.

Line 17: Format of the bond specification line.

Line 18: Neighbour separator (20 or more "-" symbols).
Separates different neighbors
:math:`(J_1, J_2, \dots)` in the template file.

Line 19: Name of the neighbour and the |latex|_ version of that name.
Name have to be specified. LaTeX name is optional.
Name and LaTeX name are separated by one or more spaces,
as a consequence no spaces are allowed for both of them.

Line 20: First bond, which corresponds to the first neighbour (:math:`J_1`).
Format of the bond specification:

.. code-block:: text

    atom1_mark atom2_mark i j k

Where R is a real-space vector of the unit cell in which the second atom is
located (atom1 always located in R = (0, 0, 0)).

Line 21, 22: Specification of the second and third bond from the first neighbour.

Line 23: Neighbour separator.

Line 24: Name of the second neighbour.

.. note::
    There is no LaTeX name specified for the second neighbour.

Lines 25-27: Specifications of the first, second and third bond, which are
associated with the second neighbour.

Lines 28: Footer of the file (20 or more "=" symbols).
