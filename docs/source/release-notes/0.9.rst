Whats new?
----------
Move from setup.py based installation to the pyproject.toml based installation. Ideally
nothing should change in the installation process for the user.

Remove the ".py" extension from the script executables. I.e. for the PDOS plots one shall
execute::

    rad-plot-dos

instead of::

    rad-plot-dos.py
